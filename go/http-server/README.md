# HTTP Server

Read data from a http connection and send a response. There's a part of the `net` package called [`http`](http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/) that has many of the methods I implement manually here. I'm writing these methods manually because I want to learn how they were made and for comparison later.

## Running

```
go run server.go
```
