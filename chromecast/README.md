# Chromecast

NodeJS package for interacting with Chromecast. Documentation of developing for the Chromecast is really, really poor, so I wasn't able to achieve a whole lot. Right now this package only supports device discovery, playing a YouTube video, and killing the YouTube app.

Also "asynchronicity" is achieved via a `setTimeout` (I know, I know this is really bad. I'll fix it).
